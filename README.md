## Overview

This repository holds a living bookdown project to develop workshop content for learning to estimate population trends from the BBS using the R-package [bbsBayes](https://github.com/BrandonEdwards/bbsBayes). Here's a link to the [workshop content](https://bookdown.org/adam_smith2/bbsbayes_intro_workshop/).

bbsBayes is a package to perform hierarchical Bayesian analysis of North American Breeding Bird Survey (BBS) data. 'bbsBayes' will run a full model analysis for one or more species that you choose, or you can take more control and specify how the data should be stratified, prepared for JAGS, or modelled.
